# Color Flipper

## Overview
Welcome to the **Color Flipper**, a dynamic and interactive project designed to randomly change background colors at the click of a button. This project is a simple yet engaging demonstration of JavaScript's ability to manipulate the DOM efficiently.

## Features
- **Random Color Generation**: Generates random HEX or RGB colors with each click.
- **Two Modes**:
  - *Simple Mode*: Selects from a predefined set of colors.
  - *Hex Mode*: Generates a completely random HEX color.
- **Minimalist & Responsive UI**: Clean design with smooth transitions.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: No dependencies, pure JavaScript solution.

## Installation
To use the Color Flipper locally, clone the repository:

```sh
 git clone https://github.com/Ak3em/Color-Flipper.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd Color-Flipper
```

Open `index.html` in your browser to see it in action.

## Usage
1. Open the project in a browser.
2. Click the **Flip Color** button to change the background color.
3. Toggle between **Simple** and **Hex** modes to explore different color styles.

## How It Works
1. **Simple Mode**: Chooses a color from a predefined array.
2. **Hex Mode**: Generates a random six-digit HEX code.
3. **Updates UI**: Applies the new color to the background and updates the displayed color code.
